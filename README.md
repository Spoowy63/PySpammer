# PySpammer
***Universal spammer that works on most chat apps***
***use at your own risk, im not responsible for what you do with this project**

### HOW TO INSTALL:
* if you install it via [Releases](https://github.com/Spoowy63/PySpammer/releases/)(read the release note). Then all you have to do is download the exe file and run it, the installation guide will help with installing it. after its done installing just run **PySpammer v1.0.exe**. it might takes a couple of sec for it to show up on your screen.

* if you want to use the script version then you have to install **python3.8+** and all the other libraries that i use in the project via **pip install [library name]**. Then you can [download the source](https://github.com/Spoowy63/PySpammer/archive/main.zip) and unpack it. after that run **PySpammer v1.0.py**.

### HOW TO USE:
* when running the script or .exe it might take up to 1 min for the program to load depending on how slow your pc is. just wait and be patient. 

* after selecting an option and entering how many times it should spam. Press **START** and then click on the typing bar of whatever chat platform you use. (if you dont know what im taking about its this thing for example https://ibb.co/hcRRhZk). Do that so it will spam there and not somehwere else. you will have around 2 sec to click that typing bar after clicking the **START** button. 

* if you want to add more random images to the folder just download some .jpg images and paste them in the **imgss** folder

* if you want to change the random text thats getting spammed just open the **text.txt** file and edit its content.
